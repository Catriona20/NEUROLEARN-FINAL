# 🎉 CONFIGURATION COMPLETE!

## ✅ You have successfully updated the API Key!

I have performed a **Hot Restart** of the application.

### 🚀 HOW TO TEST NOW

1. **Go to the App** in Chrome.
2. The "Setup Required" screen should be **GONE**.
3. You should see the **Login Screen**.
4. Enter your email: `sherylkatrina2006@gmail.com`
5. Click **"Send OTP"**.

### ✨ WHAT WILL HAPPEN

1. The app will briefly show a loading spinner.
2. Detailed logs will appear in the terminal (`[SupabaseAuth] 📧 Sending OTP...`).
3. You will receive an email with a **6-digit code**.
4. **OTP Input Boxes** will appear on screen.
5. Enter the code to login!

**Troubleshooting:**
If it still fails, check the "Spam" folder in your email.
The console logs will tell us exactly what is happening.

**ENJOY!** 🎈
