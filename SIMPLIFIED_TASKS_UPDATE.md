# 🎓 Simplified Gamified Tasks Update

## ✅ Changes Made

I have completely revamped the learning session tasks to focus on **literacy fundamentals** in a gamified way, replacing the complex Harry Potter trivia with accessible "monkey typing" and reading exercises.

### 1. **New Task Structure**
Every level now consists of 3 simple, foundational tasks:
1.  **Type**: Monkey typing practice (Input strictly validated).
2.  **Read**: Sight word reading.
3.  **Say**: Pronunciation practice.

### 2. **Gamified Typing Interaction**
- **Added Input Field**: When a task starts with "Type:", a beautiful, game-styled text field appears.
- **Validation**: Users *must* type the word correctly to proceed.
- **Feedback**: If the word is wrong, a "Keep trying!" message appears.
- **Success**: Correct typing triggers the "I Did It!" / Success state with confetti.

### 3. **Simplified Content (Levels 1-12)**
The content has been reset to progressive CVC (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant) and common sight words, making it much friendlier for the target audience.

| Level | Type Task | Read Task | Say Task |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | CAT | BAT | MAT |
| **2** | DOG | LOG | FOG |
| **3** | SUN | RUN | FUN |
| **4** | BIG | PIG | DIG |
| **5** | RED | BED | FED |
| **6** | DAY | SAY | PLAY |
| **7** | EAT | FAT | HAT |
| **8** | LOOK | BOOK | COOK |
| **9** | KITE | BITE | SIT |
| **10** | JUMP | BUMP | LAMP |
| **11** | FISH | DISH | WISH |
| **12** | STAR | FAR | CAR |

### 4. **Visual & UI Updates**
- **Input Field**: Dark glassmorphic style with golden borders to match the Harry Potter theme.
- **Button Text**: Context-aware button labels ("Check Typing" vs "I Did It!").
- **Clean Interface**: Removed complex "wand" instructions.

## 🚀 How to Test
1.  Navigate to **Journey Screen**.
2.  Select **Level 1** (or any unlocked level).
3.  **Task 1**: You will see "Type: CAT". Enter "CAT" in the box and tap "Check Typing".
4.  **Task 2**: You will see "Read: BAT". Read it and tap "I Did It!".
5.  **Task 3**: You will see "Say: MAT". Say it and tap "I Did It!".
6.  **Unlock**: Celebration and Character Unlock (Harry Potter) will appear.

The app is now running with these simplified, educational tasks!
